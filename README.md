# Python:
Python is a simple, high level ,general purpose and interpreted programming language.It is designed to be simple and easy to learn.One of the key Features of this language is their simple syntax , open source and its versibility.
Python was created by <b>Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991</b>. It focuses on readability and uses simple, English-like syntax.
Python is a Object Oriented Programming language.

# Featurse of Python:

```bash

Simple & Easy to Learn -> readable syntax.

Interpreted Language  ->no need to compile. It runs line by line code.

High-Level -> memory management handled automatically.

Portable -> runs on Windows, Linux, macOS.

Open Source -> free to use.

Large Standard Library -> many built-in modules

```

# Python Interpreter:
A Python interpreter is a program that reads, translates, and executes Python code line by line. It converts Python source code into bytecode(machine-understandable) instructions and produces output immediately.
<br>
There is no separate compilation step, which makes Python an interpreted language.
<br>

<b>How interpreter Works:</b>

```bash

1. You write Python code.

2. Interpreter reads the code line by line.

3. Code is converted into bytecode.

4. Bytecode is executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).

```
# Pyton as a Calculator:
Python can be used as a powerful calculator to perform basic and advanced mathematical calculations. This is usually done using the Python interpreter in interactive mode.
<br>

<b>How to use python as a calculator:</b>

```bash
1. Open command prompt or Terminal.

2. Type "python" . This open REPL(Read , Evaluate , Print ,Loop) in your cmd or terminal.

3. Type any calculation just like:
   
 2+2 = 4

4. For exit python type:
  
   exit()

```

# Python Shell:
The Python Shell is an interactive environment where you can write and execute Python commands one line at a time and get instant output. Python Shell is also called interactive interpreter.
<br>
It is identified by this :

```bash

>>>

```
<br>

<b>How to open Python shell :</b>

```bash

1. Open terminal or command prompt.

2. Type:
     python

3. You  will see:
    
    >>>

```

Example:

```bash
>>> print("Hello Python")
Hello Python
>>> 10 + 5
15
```
# indentation in python:
Indentation means the spaces or tabs at the beginning of a line of code.In Python, indentation is very important because it is used to define blocks of code.
<br>
 Unlike C, C++ or Java (which use { }), Python uses indentation to show structure or define the block of code.
<br>

<b>Why Indentation is important:</b>

```bash
1.It tells Python which statements belong together.

2.Controls the flow of:

if-else

for and while loops

functions

classes

3.Wrong indentation causes an Indentation error

```
Example:

```bash
num=8

if num%2==0:
    print("even number")
else:
    print(" odd number")    

```
