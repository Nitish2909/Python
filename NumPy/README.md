# What is NumPy :
NumPy is a Python Library that is used for working with Arrays.
Numpy was created in 2005 Travis Oliphant.It is an open source project that you can use it freely.
<br>
NumPy Stands for Numerical Python.

# Why use NumPy :
NumPy is used to do fast , easy and powerful Numerical calculation in Python.
<br>
In simple world we can say that Numpy is a super- power calculator for Python.
<br>

Here are some points why use NumPy :

```bash
Why we use NumPy:

1. Fast calculations :
NumPy works much faster than normal Python lists, especially for large data.

2. Easy to handle large data :
It can store and process thousands or millions of numbers easily.

3. Less code, more work :
One line of NumPy code can do the work of many Python lines.

4. Best for math & data science:
Used in Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, and scientific calculations.

```
<br>

<b>Example :</b>

```bash
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7])

print(arr)

```
# Creating NumPy Arrays :
<b>Create a NumPy ndarray Object :</b>
<br>

NumPy is used to work with arrays. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray.
<br><br>
We can create a NumPy ndarray object by using the array() function.
<br>

Example:

```bash
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([10 ,20,30,40,50])

print(arr)

print(type(arr))

```
